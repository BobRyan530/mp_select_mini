# mp_select_mini
This is intended to be a repo easing use of the Monoprice Select Mini 3D printer.

I wasn't able to find a cura 2.1 profile online so I modified the Prusa i3 profile and produced this. 
On my system the machine profile goes in /usr/share/cura/resources/machines

I haven't made any changes to the included resources/meshes/mp_select_mini.stl file (it's purely a copy of the Prusa i3 stl.

Putting these files in ~/.local/share/cura/resources... doesn't seem to work.
